Assignment 1 COMP90051 Statistical Machine Learning
Alejandro Arias, Melissa Speer, Felipe Ramos

The code is in two Jupyter notebook with python 3 
List of dependencies:
pandas, scikit learn, numpy and networkx to calculate the feature metrics.

The first jupyter notebook handle the pre-processing stages in the next:
1)	Partition of training and development sets
2)	Hypergraph papers list to edges list transformation
3)	Graph generation using network library
4)	Negative examples generation for both training and development set
5)	Feature calculation (several feature_maker functions) for training, development and test set using the graph.
6)	Exporting files


The second Jupyter notebook called “Models” and contains the train the models logistic regression, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest.
 Then, the hyperparameter tuning, error analysis and format and exporting the final prediction.
